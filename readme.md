# Dystopian Horror

A short horror game I developed in Wargaming Academy. Its main feature is that some pieces of the environment change when you don't look at them. E.g., if you enter a room, it moves to another place to confuse and scare the player. It was inspired by [Layers of Fear](https://youtu.be/CyDs5UJfvks).
